      "<p>The nuclear-powered <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Project_949A\" title=\"Project 949A\">Project 949A <i>Antey</i></a> (Oscar II class) submarine <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/K-141_Kursk\" title=\"K-141 Kursk\">K-141 <i>Kursk</i></a> sank in an accident on 12 August 2000 in the <a href=\"/wiki/Barents_Sea\" title=\"Barents Sea\">Barents Sea</a>. It was taking part in the first major Russian naval exercise in more than 10 years. All 118 personnel on board were killed. The crews of nearby ships felt an initial explosion and a second, much larger explosion, but the <a href=\"/wiki/Russian_Navy\" title=\"Russian Navy\">Russian Navy</a> did not realise that an accident had occurred and did not initiate a search for the vessel for over six hours. The submarine's emergency <a href=\"/wiki/Rescue_buoy_(submarine)\" title=\"Rescue buoy (submarine)\">rescue buoy</a> had been intentionally disabled during an earlier mission and it took more than 16 hours to locate the submarine, which rested on the ocean floor at a depth of 108 m (354 ft).\n",
      "</p><p>Over four days, the Russian Navy repeatedly failed in its attempts to attach four different <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Diving_bells\" title=\"Diving bells\">diving bells</a> and submersibles to the escape hatch of the submarine. Its response was criticised as slow and inept. Officials misled and manipulated the public and news media, and refused help from other countries' ships nearby. President <a href=\"/wiki/Vladimir_Putin\" title=\"Vladimir Putin\">Vladimir Putin</a> initially continued his vacation at a seaside resort in <a href=\"/wiki/Sochi\" title=\"Sochi\">Sochi</a><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> and authorised the Russian Navy to accept British and Norwegian assistance only after five days had passed. Two days later, British and Norwegian divers finally opened a hatch to the <a href=\"/wiki/Escape_trunk\" title=\"Escape trunk\">escape trunk</a> in the boat's flooded ninth <a href=\"/wiki/Compartment_(ship)\" title=\"Compartment (ship)\">compartment</a>, but found no survivors.\n",
      "</p><p>An official investigation concluded that when the crew loaded a dummy <a href=\"/wiki/Type_65_torpedo\" title=\"Type 65 torpedo\">65-76 \"Kit\" torpedo</a>, a faulty weld in its casing leaked <a href=\"/wiki/High-test_peroxide\" title=\"High-test peroxide\">high-test peroxide</a> (HTP) inside the torpedo tube, initiating a catalytic explosion.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-paschoa_2-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-paschoa-2\">[2]</a></sup> The torpedo manufacturer challenged this hypothesis, insisting that its design would prevent the kind of event described. The explosion blew off both the inner and outer tube doors, ignited a fire, destroyed the bulkhead between the first and second compartments, damaged the control room in the second compartment, and incapacitated or killed the torpedo room and control-room crew. Two minutes and fifteen seconds after the first explosion, another five to seven torpedo <a href=\"/wiki/Warhead\" title=\"Warhead\">warheads</a> exploded. They tore a large hole in the hull, collapsed bulkheads between the first three compartments and all the decks, destroyed compartment four, and killed everyone still alive forward of the sixth compartment. The nuclear reactors shut down safely. Analysts concluded that 23 sailors took refuge in the small ninth compartment and survived for more than six hours. When oxygen ran low, they attempted to replace a <a href=\"/wiki/Potassium_superoxide\" title=\"Potassium superoxide\">potassium superoxide</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Chemical_oxygen_generator\" title=\"Chemical oxygen generator\">chemical oxygen cartridge</a>, but it fell into the oily sea water and exploded on contact. The resulting fire killed several crew members and triggered a <a href=\"/wiki/Flash_fire\" title=\"Flash fire\">flash fire</a> that consumed the remaining oxygen, suffocating the remaining survivors.\n",
      "</p><p>The Dutch company <a href=\"/wiki/Mammoet\" title=\"Mammoet\">Mammoet</a> was awarded a salvage contract in May 2001. Within a three-month period, the company and its subcontractors designed, fabricated, installed, and commissioned over 3,000 t (3,000 long tons; 3,300 short tons) of custom-made equipment. A barge was modified and loaded with the equipment, arriving in the Barents Sea in August.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> On October 3, 2001, some 15 months after the accident, the hull was raised from the seabed floor and hauled to a dry dock.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> The salvage team recovered all but the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Bow_(ship)\" title=\"Bow (ship)\">bow</a>, including the remains of 115 sailors, who were later buried in Russia.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-recovery-paper-2003_5-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-recovery-paper-2003-5\">[5]</a></sup> The <a href=\"/wiki/Government_of_Russia\" title=\"Government of Russia\">government of Russia</a> and the Russian Navy were intensely criticised over the incident and their responses. A four-page summary of a 133-volume, top-secret investigation revealed \"stunning breaches of discipline, shoddy, obsolete and poorly maintained equipment\", and \"negligence, incompetence, and mismanagement\".

      "<p>The nuclear-powered <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Project_949A\" title=\"Project 949A\">Project 949A <i>Antey</i></a> (Oscar II class) submarine <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/K-141_Kursk\" title=\"K-141 Kursk\">K-141 <i>Kursk</i></a> sank in an accident on 12 August 2000 in the <a href=\"/wiki/Barents_Sea\" title=\"Barents Sea\">Barents Sea</a>. It was taking part in the first major Russian naval exercise in more than 10 years. All 118 personnel on board were killed. The crews of nearby ships felt an initial explosion and a second, much larger explosion, but the <a href=\"/wiki/Russian_Navy\" title=\"Russian Navy\">Russian Navy</a> did not realise that an accident had occurred and did not initiate a search for the vessel for over six hours. The submarine's emergency <a href=\"/wiki/Rescue_buoy_(submarine)\" title=\"Rescue buoy (submarine)\">rescue buoy</a> had been intentionally disabled during an earlier mission and it took more than 16 hours to locate the submarine, which rested on the ocean floor at a depth of 108 m (354 ft).\n",
      "</p><p>Over four days, the Russian Navy repeatedly failed in its attempts to attach four different <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Diving_bells\" title=\"Diving bells\">diving bells</a> and submersibles to the escape hatch of the submarine. Its response was criticised as slow and inept. Officials misled and manipulated the public and news media, and refused help from other countries' ships nearby. President <a href=\"/wiki/Vladimir_Putin\" title=\"Vladimir Putin\">Vladimir Putin</a> initially continued his vacation at a seaside resort in <a href=\"/wiki/Sochi\" title=\"Sochi\">Sochi</a><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> and authorised the Russian Navy to accept British and Norwegian assistance only after five days had passed. Two days later, British and Norwegian divers finally opened a hatch to the <a href=\"/wiki/Escape_trunk\" title=\"Escape trunk\">escape trunk</a> in the boat's flooded ninth <a href=\"/wiki/Compartment_(ship)\" title=\"Compartment (ship)\">compartment</a>, but found no survivors.\n",
      "</p><p>An official investigation concluded that when the crew loaded a dummy <a href=\"/wiki/Type_65_torpedo\" title=\"Type 65 torpedo\">65-76 \"Kit\" torpedo</a>, a faulty weld in its casing leaked <a href=\"/wiki/High-test_peroxide\" title=\"High-test peroxide\">high-test peroxide</a> (HTP) inside the torpedo tube, initiating a catalytic explosion.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-paschoa_2-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-paschoa-2\">[2]</a></sup> The torpedo manufacturer challenged this hypothesis, insisting that its design would prevent the kind of event described. The explosion blew off both the inner and outer tube doors, ignited a fire, destroyed the bulkhead between the first and second compartments, damaged the control room in the second compartment, and incapacitated or killed the torpedo room and control-room crew. Two minutes and fifteen seconds after the first explosion, another five to seven torpedo <a href=\"/wiki/Warhead\" title=\"Warhead\">warheads</a> exploded. They tore a large hole in the hull, collapsed bulkheads between the first three compartments and all the decks, destroyed compartment four, and killed everyone still alive forward of the sixth compartment. The nuclear reactors shut down safely. Analysts concluded that 23 sailors took refuge in the small ninth compartment and survived for more than six hours. When oxygen ran low, they attempted to replace a <a href=\"/wiki/Potassium_superoxide\" title=\"Potassium superoxide\">potassium superoxide</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Chemical_oxygen_generator\" title=\"Chemical oxygen generator\">chemical oxygen cartridge</a>, but it fell into the oily sea water and exploded on contact. The resulting fire killed several crew members and triggered a <a href=\"/wiki/Flash_fire\" title=\"Flash fire\">flash fire</a> that consumed the remaining oxygen, suffocating the remaining survivors.\n",
      "</p><p>The Dutch company <a href=\"/wiki/Mammoet\" title=\"Mammoet\">Mammoet</a> was awarded a salvage contract in May 2001. Within a three-month period, the company and its subcontractors designed, fabricated, installed, and commissioned over 3,000 t (3,000 long tons; 3,300 short tons) of custom-made equipment. A barge was modified and loaded with the equipment, arriving in the Barents Sea in August.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> On October 3, 2001, some 15 months after the accident, the hull was raised from the seabed floor and hauled to a dry dock.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> The salvage team recovered all but the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Bow_(ship)\" title=\"Bow (ship)\">bow</a>, including the remains of 115 sailors, who were later buried in Russia.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-recovery-paper-2003_5-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-recovery-paper-2003-5\">[5]</a></sup> The <a href=\"/wiki/Government_of_Russia\" title=\"Government of Russia\">government of Russia</a> and the Russian Navy were intensely criticised over the incident and their responses. A four-page summary of a 133-volume, top-secret investigation revealed \"stunning breaches of discipline, shoddy, obsolete and poorly maintained equipment\", and \"negligence, incompetence, and mismanagement\". It concluded that the rescue operation was unjustifiably delayed and that the Russian Navy was completely unprepared to respond to the disaster.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-brannon_6-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-brannon-6\">[6]</a></sup>\n",
